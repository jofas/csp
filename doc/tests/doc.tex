\section{Tests}
\label{sec:tests}

This chapter will present two conducted tests. The
first one will visualize what the descision surface of the
PCF looks like, the second will show how the PCF behaves
with different amounts of Trees.

Both tests are performed on a randomly generated,
normalized, two dimensional dataset. The dataset contains
five thousand observations.

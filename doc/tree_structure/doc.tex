\section{The Tree structure}
\label{sec:tree}

A Tree generated by the PCF is a binary search tree
structure similar to k-d trees. Its purpose is to randomly
generate disjoint partitions of a feature space.

A Tree has two types of nodes, non-leaf nodes, here denoted
as Nodes and leaf nodes denoted as Leafs. It provides two
operations: (\romannumeral 1) FIT, initializing the Tree
and (\romannumeral 2) PREDICT, returning a label for an
oberservation.

The Node structure contains three properties:
(\romannumeral 1) a split value; (\romannumeral 2) a left
and (\romannumeral 3) a right successor, both references to
either another Node or a Leaf.

A Leaf on the other hand, is the structure
representing a partition of the feature space, having the
following properties: (\romannumeral 1) active: a boolean
value deciding whether the partition's quality, determined
during the FIT operation, is equal or better than the
defined threshold or not; (\romannumeral 2) optionally a
predictor which is used to classify oberservations during
the PREDICT operation. Only if a Leaf's active property is
true, a predictor must be provided. A Leaf also has two
vectors with arbitrary length as properties:
(\romannumeral 3) a vector containing the observations of
the dataset used in FIT, which are laying inside the
partition and (\romannumeral 4) their inherent labels.

During the FIT operation a Tree contains a third type of
node, Nil. Nil is used to initialize Trees
and the left and right successor of a Node. These nodes are
transformed during FIT to either a Node or a Leaf, so after
the FIT operation a Tree does not contain Nil nodes
anymore. A Nil node does not have any properties.

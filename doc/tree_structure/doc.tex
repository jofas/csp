\section{The Tree structure}
\label{sec:tree}

A Tree generated by the PCF is an instance of a binary
search tree structure similar to the k-d tree.
Its purpose is to randomly generate disjoint partitions of
the feature space of a given dataset.

A Tree has two types of nodes: non-leaf nodes --- here
denoted as (\romannumeral 1) Nodes --- and leaf nodes
denoted as  (\romannumeral 2) Leaves. It provides two
operations: (\romannumeral 1) FIT, initializing the Tree
and (\romannumeral 2) PREDICT, returning a label for an
observation or $\Lambda$ if uncertain.

The Node structure contains three properties:
(\romannumeral 1) a split value; (\romannumeral 2) a left
and (\romannumeral 3) a right successor, both references to
either another Node or a Leaf.

A Leaf on the other hand is the structure representing a
partition of the feature space, having the following
properties: (\romannumeral 1) $active$: a boolean value
deciding whether the partition' quality --- determined
during the FIT operation --- equals or exceeds the
defined quality threshold; (\romannumeral 2) optionally a
classifier which is used to classify observations during
the PREDICT operation. Only if a Leaf's $active$ property
is true, a classifier must be provided. A Leaf also has two
vectors with arbitrary length as properties:
(\romannumeral 3) a vector containing the observations of
the dataset used in FIT, which are laying inside the
partition and (\romannumeral 4) their inherent labels.

During the FIT operation a Tree contains a third type of
node, Nil. Nil is used to initialize Trees
and the left and right successor of a Node. These nodes are
transformed during FIT to either a Node or a Leaf, so after
the FIT operation a Tree does not contain Nil nodes
anymore. A Nil node does not have any properties.

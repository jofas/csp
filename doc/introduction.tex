\section{Introduction}

Some datasets do not allow a classifier to generate a
descision surface good enough to be able to predict unseen
observations well. Well, in this case, refers to a
context dependent threshold for any quality measurement of
a classifier, for example the accuracy or an information
loss metric.

But for some of those problems, it may still be valuable
to predict only on partitions of the feature space, in
which the dataset is `clean' enough, meaning a classifier
can be found within the subset of the dataset laying inside
one of those partitions which equals or exceeds the
threshold.

This paper proposes a Monte Carlo based ensemble method
called Partial Classification Forest (PCF), which builds an
ensemble of trees having a structure similar to
k-d trees to partition the feature space of the dataset in
order to find `clean' partitions. In the following a
tree generated by the PCF is spelled Tree with a capital
T, rather than tree, which is used to denote the tree data
structure.

It should be noted here, that this paper is rather a Proof
of Concept of a very early version of the PCF and has
several shortcomings in research and empirical tests, due
to a lack of time and no complete, fast implementation. I
will discuss these shortcomings further in
Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}, but the most important ones I
will list right away:

\begin{itemize}

\item Tests with a more sofisticated $\gamma$ (cmp.
      Section~\ref{subsec:fit})

\item The PCF's performance on high dimensional data

\item Untested possible optimizations and features (cmp.
      Section~\ref{sec:features})

\item A Tree's growing behaviour

\item Benchmarks

\end{itemize}

In Section~\ref{sec:tree} I will lay out
the structure and the operations of a Tree generated by the
PCF before, in Section~\ref{sec:pcf}, describing how the
PCF utilizes Tree instances. After that I will continue
displaying the application of the PCF\@. In Section~%
\ref{sec:features} I will discuss possible additional
features before finishing with a conclusion.
